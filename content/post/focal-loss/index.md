Paper: [Calibrating Deep Neural Networks using Focal Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09437)

### What we want
* Overparameterised classifier deep neural networks trained on the conventional cross-entropy objective are known to be [overconfident and thus miscalibrated](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599).
* With these networks being deployed in real-life applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, it is imperative for them to predict with calibrated confidence estimates.
* Ideally, we want a model which is *confident on its correct predictions*, produces *calibrated probability estimates* and also achieves *state-of-the-art test set accuracy*.

### What we do
* We explore an alternative loss function, [**focal loss**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) for training models.
* Focal loss significantly **outperforms cross-entropy** and other baselines on calibration error scores (e.g. ECE) **without compromising on test set accuracy**.
* This improvement in focal loss is present both **pre and post temperature scaling**.
* We propose a sample-dependent adaptive way of deciding $\gamma$, the focal loss hyperparameter.
* Finally, we show that training on focal loss can be better than post-hoc calibration using temperature scaling, especially on **out-of-distribution samples**.

## What Causes Miscalibration?

* We train a ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10 using cross-entropy loss for 350 epochs.
* The initial learning rate is 0.1 and it drops by a factor of 10 at epochs 150 and 250.
* We plot the NLL and entropy of the softmax distribution over the course of training for both correctly and incorrectly classified train and test samples.

</p>

Two observations are worth noting from the above plots:
1. **Curse of misclassified samples:** The NLL overfitting is quite apparent after training epoch 150. Also, *the rise in test set NLL is only because of misclassified test samples*.
2. **Peak at the wrong place:** While the test set NLL rises, the test set entropy decreases throughout training even for misclassified samples. Hence, *the model gets more and more confident on its predictions irrespective of their correctness*.

We posit the reason behind the above observations as follows:
* Even after obtaining a 100% training accuracy, the optimiser can still reduce the loss further by increasing the model's confidences on its predictions.
* In order to increase its confidence, the model *increases the magnitudes of the logits which in turn is achieved by increasing the magnitudes of its weights*.


## Improving Calibration using Focal Loss

We explore an alternative loss function, [focal loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002). Below are the forms of the two loss functions, cross-entropy (CE) and focal loss (Focal) (assuming one-hot ground truth encodings):

$$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CE}} = - \log p$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Focal}} = -(1-p)^\gamma \log p$$


In the above equations $p$ is the probability assigned by the model to the ground-truth correct class. When compared with cross-entropy, focal loss has an added $(1-p)^\gamma$ factor. The idea behind this is to give more preference to samples for which the model is placing less probability mass on the correct class. $\gamma$ is a hyperparameter.

### Why might focal loss improve calibration?

**Focal Loss minimises a regularised KL divergence.**
We know that cross-entropy loss minimises the [Kullback-Leibler (KL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) divergence between the target distribution $q$ over classes and the predicted softmax distribution $\hat{p}$. As it turns out, focal loss minimises a *regularised KL divergence* between the target and predicted distributions as shown below.

$$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Focal}} \geq \mathrm{KL}(q||\hat{p}) - \gamma \mathbb{H}[\hat{p}]$$

* The regulariser is the entropy of the predicted distribution and the regularisation coefficient is $\gamma$.
* Hence, focal loss tries to minimise the KL divergence between the predicted and target distributions while at the same time increasing the entropy of the predicted distribution.
* Note that in the case of one-hot target distributions, only the component of entropy corresponding to the ground-truth correct class (i.e., $\gamma(-p \log p)$) is maximised.
* This *prevents the predicted softmax distributions from becoming too peaky (low entropy)* and the model from becoming overconfident.


### How does focal loss fare on NLL overfitting?

On the same training setup as above (i.e., ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10), if we use focal loss with $\gamma$ values set to 1, 2 and 3, the test set NLL vs training epochs plot is as follows.

<p align="center">
    <img src="test_nll.png" width="400" />
    <em>Fig. 3: Test set NLL computed over different training epochs for ResNet-50 models trained using cross-entropy and focal loss with $\gamma$ values 1,2 and 3.</em>
</p>

* **NLL overfitting is significantly reduced for models trained using focal loss!** 
* There also seems to be an ordering to this betterment where focal loss with $\gamma=3$ outperforms focal loss with $\gamma=2$, which outperforms the one with $\gamma=1$.

### Does focal loss regularise model weights?

If we consider the gradient of focal loss with respect to the last layer model weights $w$ and the same for cross-entropy, we find that for a single sample, the following relation exists.

$$\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Focal}}}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial w}g(p, \gamma)$$


The factor $g(p, \gamma)$ is a function of both the predicted correct class probability $p$ and $\gamma$. On plotting $g(p, \gamma)$ against $p$ for different values of $\gamma$, we get the following plot.

<p align="center">
    <img src="g_p_t_gamma.png" width="400" />
    <em>Fig. 4: $g(p, \gamma)$ vs $p$ plot.</em>
</p>

* We see a pattern here, that higher $\gamma$ leads to higher gradient in focal loss for low values of $p$ and dying gradients for higher $p$. 
* We use this observation to *adaptively select* $\gamma$ *sample wise* such that the network can give more weight to samples with lower correct class probability. We call this training method as FLSD.
* For each value of $\gamma$, $g(p, \gamma) < 1$ when $p$ is above a certain threshold probability.
* This means that during training, *once the network starts getting more confident on its predictions, the gradients for focal loss start having lower and lower norm* as compared to the gradients for cross-entropy.
* Accordingly, the *weight norms for focal loss should also reduce as compared to that of cross-entropy*. To see this empirically, we plot the weight norms of the last linear layer for our training setup.

<p align="center">
    <img src="weight_norm.png" width="400" />
    <em>Fig. 5: Weight norm of the last linear layer over the course of training.</em>
</p>

* For the first few training epochs, the focal loss weight norms are larger than cross-entropy.
* However, after epoch 150, the point from where the network starts getting miscalibrated, *the ordering of weight norms completely reverses and focal loss has lower weight norms than cross-entropy*.

This provides strong evidence in favour of our hypothesis that **focal loss regularises weight norms in the network once the network achieves a certain level of confidence on its predictions**.

## Empirical Results

### Classification Results (Calibration and Accuracy)

* We test the performance of focal loss on several datasets, architectures and using multiple different calibration error scores which include the [Expected Calibration Error](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/research/AAAI_Calibration.pdf) (ECE), Adaptive ECE (AdaECE), Classwise-ECE and others.
* We also compare with loss baselines other than cross-entropy, like [Brier Score](https://journals.ametsoc.org/mwr/article/78/1/1/96424/VERIFICATION-OF-FORECASTS-EXPRESSED-IN-TERMS-OF), [MMCE](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/kumar18a/kumar18a.pdf) and cross-entropy with [label smoothing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02629.pdf).
* We present error bars with confidence intervals for ECE, AdaECE and Classwise-ECE for ResNet-50 and ResNet-110 trained on [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) as well as the test set classification error for the same models below.

| Model Architecture  | Cross-Entropy | Brier Loss | MMCE | LS-0.05 | FL-3 (Ours) | FLSD-53 (Ours) |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ResNet-50  | 4.95 | 5.0 | 4.99 | 5.29 | 5.25 | 4.98 |
| ResNet-110  | 4.89 | 5.48 | 5.4 | 5.52 | 5.08 | 5.42 |


* Models trained using **focal loss broadly outperform all other baselines on all the metrics both before and after temperature scaling**!
* In quite a few cases, the difference in performance is statistically significant.
* Moreover, models trained on focal loss do not compromise on test set error or accuracy. All the models we train obtain test set classification errors in the same ballpark.


### Detection of OOD Samples

We run the models trained using CIFAR-10 on test data drawn from the [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers) dataset which is out-of-distribution and consider the softmax entropy of these networks as a measure of uncertainty. For ResNet-110, the ROC plots obtained from this experiment are provided below.

    <em>Fig. 7: ROC plots obtained from ResNet-110 trained on CIFAR-10 and tested on SVHN. Left: pre-temperature scaling, right: post-temperature scaling.</em>
</p>

* The results indicate that models trained on focal loss, with *higher AUROC*, are able to detect out-of-distribution samples from SVHN much better than models trained on cross-entropy loss.
* What is particularly important to see here is that this improved performance is shown both pre and post temperature scaling!

Thus, focal loss seems to be a good alternative to the conventionally used cross-entropy loss for producing confident and calibrated models without compromising on classification accuracy.
