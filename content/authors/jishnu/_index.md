I am a second year DPhil (PhD) student in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, advised by Professor [Philip Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst) in the [*Torr Vision Group*](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg) and Professor [Yarin Gal](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal/website) in [*Oxford Applied and Theoretical Machine Learning Group*](https://oatml.cs.ox.ac.uk). I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering from *Jadavpur University*, Kolkata, India and completed my Master of Science (MSc) in Computer Science from the *University of Oxford*.

My current research focuses on *uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks* using Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches in a scalable, computationally light-weight manner with applications in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.
