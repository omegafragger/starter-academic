I am a final year DPhil (PhD) student in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, advised by Professor [Philip Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst) in [Torr Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg) and Professor [Yarin Gal](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal/website) in [OATML](https://oatml.cs.ox.ac.uk). I have also been closely supervised by [Dr. Puneet Dokania](https://puneetkdokania.github.io). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India and completed my Master of Science (MSc) in Computer Science from the University of Oxford.

My research mainly focuses on *scalable uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks* with applications in large computer vision problems. I am also interested in *foundation models*.
