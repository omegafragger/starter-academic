summary: Spotlight Talk at the ICML 2020, Workshop on Uncertainty and Robustness in Deep Learning
abstract: "Miscalibration – a mismatch between a model’s confidence and its correctness – of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) makes their predictions hard to rely on. Ideally, we want networks to be accurate and calibrated. In this work, we study focal loss as an alternative to the conventional cross-entropy loss and show that, focal loss allows us to learn models that are comparitively well calibrated while preserving accuracy. We provide
a thorough analysis of the factors causing miscalibration, and use the insights we glean from
this to justify the superior performance of focal
loss. Finally, we perform extensive experiments
on a variety of datasets, and with a wide variety of network architectures, and show that focal
loss indeed achieves excellent calibration without
compromising on accuracy in almost all cases."
